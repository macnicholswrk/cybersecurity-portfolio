  Foundations of Cybersecurity

What is Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks. These attacks aim to access, alter, or destroy information, disrupt operations, or extort money.
Cybersecurity focuses on:
Prevention
Detection
Response
Recovery

CIA Triad
Confidentiality – Prevents unauthorized access to data (Encryption, Access controls, Authentication)
Integrity – Ensures data is accurate and not altered (Hashing, Checksums, File permissions)
Availability – Ensures systems and data are accessible when needed (Backups, Redundancy, DDoS protection)

Common Cyber Threats
Malware (viruses, ransomware, trojans)
Phishing
Insider threats
Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS)
Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)

Why Cybersecurity Matters
Protects personal and organizational data
Prevents financial loss
Maintains trust and business continuity
Required for compliance and regulations



  Cybersecurity Roles & Responsibilities

Security Teams
SOC (Security Operations Center) – Monitors alerts and responds to incidents
Blue Team – Defensive security (monitoring, detection, response)
Red Team – Offensive security (simulated attacks, penetration testing)
Purple Team – Collaboration between red and blue teams

Entry-Level Roles
SOC Analyst (Tier 1)
Junior Security Analyst
IT Support (security-focused)
Security Operations Technician

Responsibilities
Monitoring alerts
Investigating suspicious activity
Reviewing logs
Escalating incidents
Following response procedures
Core Skills
Operating systems (Windows/Linux)
Networking fundamentals
Log analysis
Incident response workflows
Communication & documentation
Scripting & automation basics
Ethics & Professionalism
Follow ethical guidelines
Protect user privacy
Only access authorized systems
Follow laws and company policies



  Security Frameworks & Controls

Security Frameworks
NIST Cybersecurity Framework
ISO/IEC 27001
CIS Controls
NIST Core Functions
Identify – Understand assets, risks, vulnerabilities
Protect – Implement safeguards
Detect – Monitor systems & logs
Respond – Contain & mitigate incidents
Recover – Restore services & improve defenses

Security Controls
Administrative – policies, training, procedures
Technical – firewalls, antivirus, encryption
Physical – locks, cameras, badges
Preventive vs Detective Controls
Preventive: Firewalls, strong authentication, access restrictions
Detective: Logs, alerts, IDS

Documentation Importance
Critical for incident response, compliance, communication, and improving security



  Networking & System Security Basics

Networking Fundamentals
Computers communicate using IP addresses and ports
Protocols define rules (TCP, UDP, HTTP/HTTPS)

Firewalls & Security Devices
Firewall = gatekeeper
IDS = watches for suspicious activity
IPS = blocks suspicious activity automatically

System Security Basics
Keep software updated
Use strong passwords and MFA
Limit user access to only what’s necessary

  Security Operations & Incident Response

Security Operations
SOC analysts monitor alerts and escalate incidents

Tools: SIEMs, logs (Windows/Linux), dashboards, alerts

Incident Response Steps
Identify – detect suspicious activity
Contain – stop spread
Eradicate – remove threat
Recover – restore systems
Lessons learned – improve security

  Threats & Vulnerabilities

Common Threats
Malware, phishing, ransomware, insider threats
Vulnerabilities
Weak passwords, outdated software, misconfigured devices
Mitigation Tips
Patch software
Use firewalls & antivirus
Train users
Monitor logs for unusual behavior

  Connect and Protect: Networks and Network Security

Network Security Essentials
Firewalls, IDS/IPS, VPNs
Network segmentation to limit attacks
Monitoring traffic for suspicious patterns
Encrypt data in transit
Practical Skills
Understand TCP/IP and protocols
Use security devices to protect assets
Apply security principles to network design
