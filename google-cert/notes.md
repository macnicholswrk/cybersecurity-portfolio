Module 1: Foundations of Cybersecurity
What is Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks. These attacks aim to access, alter, or destroy information, disrupt operations, or extort money.

Cybersecurity focuses on:
Prevention
Detection
Response
Recovery

CIA Triad

The CIA Triad is the core security model:

Confidentiality
  Prevents unauthorized access to data
  Examples:
  Encryption
  Access controls
  Authentication

Integrity
  Ensures data is accurate and not altered
  Examples:
  Hashing
  Checksums
  File permissions

Availability
  Ensures systems and data are accessible when needed
  Examples:
  Backups
  Redundancy
  DDoS protection

Common Cyber Threats
Malware – malicious software (viruses, ransomware, trojans)
Phishing – deceptive messages to steal credentials
Insider threats – employees misusing access
Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) – overwhelming systems to make them unavailable
Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) – intercepting communications


Why Cybersecurity Matters
Protects personal and organizational data
Prevents financial loss
Maintains trust and business continuity
Required for compliance and regulations

Module 2: Cybersecurity Roles & Responsibilities
Security Teams

Cybersecurity work is divided into specialized roles:

SOC (Security Operations Center)
Monitors alerts and responds to incidents

Blue Team
Defensive security (monitoring, detection, response)

Red Team
Offensive security (simulated attacks, penetration testing)

Purple Team
Collaboration between red and blue teams

Entry-Level Cybersecurity Roles

Common starting positions:
SOC Analyst (Tier 1)
Junior Security Analyst
IT Support (security-focused)
Security Operations Technician

Responsibilities often include:
Monitoring alerts
Investigating suspicious activity
Reviewing logs
Escalating incidents
Following response procedures

Core Skills for Cybersecurity
Understanding operating systems (Windows/Linux)
Networking fundamentals
Log analysis
Incident response workflows
Communication and documentation
Scripting and automation basics

Ethics & Professionalism
Security professionals must:
Follow ethical guidelines
Protect user privacy
Only access authorized systems
Follow laws and company policies

Module 3: Security Frameworks & Controls
Security Frameworks

Frameworks provide structured approaches to managing security.

Common frameworks:
NIST Cybersecurity Framework
ISO/IEC 27001
CIS Controls

They help organizations:
Identify risks
Protect assets
Detect incidents
Respond effectively
Recover from attacks

NIST Cybersecurity Framework (Core Functions)
Identify – Understand assets, risks, and vulnerabilities
Protect – Implement safeguards (firewalls, access controls)
Detect – Monitor systems and logs
Respond – Contain and mitigate incidents
Recover – Restore services and improve defenses

Security Controls
Security controls reduce risk and protect systems.

Types of controls:
Administrative – policies, procedures, training
Technical – firewalls, antivirus, encryption
Physical – locks, cameras, badge access
Preventive vs Detective Controls

Preventive controls stop incidents before they happen
Examples:
Firewalls
Strong authentication
Access restrictions

Detective controls identify incidents after they occur
Examples:
Logs
Alerts
Intrusion detection systems (IDS)

Importance of Documentation
Documentation is critical for:
Incident response
Compliance
Communication between teams
Improving future security posture
Clear documentation makes security teams effective and auditable.
