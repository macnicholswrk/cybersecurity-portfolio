Module 4: Networking & System Security Basics

Networking Fundamentals
Computers talk to each other using IP addresses.
Ports let multiple programs use the same connection (e.g., HTTP = 80, HTTPS = 443).
Protocols are rules for communication (TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS).

Firewalls & Security Devices
Firewall = gatekeeper for network traffic.
IDS (Intrusion Detection System) = watches for suspicious activity.
IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) = blocks suspicious activity automatically.

System Security Basics
Keep software updated → prevents exploits.
Use strong passwords and multi-factor authentication.
Limit access: only give people accounts/resources they need.



Module 5: Security Operations & Incident Response

Security Operations
Security teams monitor for alerts and suspicious activity.
SOC Analysts handle daily alerts and escalate incidents if needed.

Key tools:
SIEMs (Security Information and Event Management)
Logs (Windows Event Logs, Linux syslogs)
Dashboards & alerts

Incident Response Steps
Identify → Detect something suspicious.
Contain → Stop spread if it’s malware.
Eradicate → Remove threat.
Recover → Restore systems safely.
Lessons learned → Improve security for next time.



Module 6: Threats & Vulnerabilities

Common Threats
Malware: software meant to harm computers
Phishing: tricking users to give credentials
Ransomware: encrypts files and demands money
Insider threats: employees misusing access

Vulnerabilities
Weak passwords
Outdated software
Misconfigured networks or devices

Mitigation Tips
Patch software and devices
Use firewalls and antivirus
Train users on phishing awareness
Monitor logs for unusual behavior
